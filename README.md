# Fantasy Football Tool
Hi! I'm not very well versed in which football players are worth paying attention to and the news only highlights a few of the many so I wrote this a few hours before my draft to help me out.

## What is it?
This is a simple tool that takes a information from a [large dataset of player stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/10el4v5/gigantic_2022_fantasy_stats_dataset_download/) from each game last season and throws them together to grab the medians and means of certain stats from last season.
I used a jupyter notebook file because classes made me comfortable with them and the way they return graphs is really nice with VSCode. It's also really good for writing and testing in increments because data.head() is a lot easier than manually outputting the dataset.

## Did it work?
The tool worked perfectly and helped me a lot, ESPNFantasy projects me as #1 in the final standings(subject to change as the season begins)
No one is curious but here is my starting lineup:
QB: Josh Allen
RB1: Joe Mixon
RB2: Najee Harris
WR1: Cooper Kupp(risky pick I'll admit)
WR2: Chris Godwin
TE: George Kittle(I know he's old)
FLX: Michael Pittman Jr.
DEF: Saints
K: Evan McPherson

## Going forward
With school coming up and other stuff to do(Leetcode, Calendar, finishing AWS cert) I probably won't be able to touch this during the school year. I want to build upon this to perform some actual ML, like Amazon and ESPN do, next summer but I have a long time until then.
